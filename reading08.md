RBAC definition
RBAC is the idea of assigning system access to users based on their role within an organization. The system needs of a given workforce are analyzed, with users grouped into roles based on common job responsibilities and system access needs. Access is then assigned to each person based strictly on their role assignment. With tight adherence to access requirements established for each role, access management becomes much easier.

RBAC vs. ABAC vs. ACL
There are some alternatives for/variations of RBAC, including:

Access control lists (ACL) — An ACL is a means of defining access rights by a given user or user group, to a specific object, such as a document.  As a simple example, an ACL could be used to allow users from one department to make changes to a document, while only allowing users from other departments to read the document.

Attribute-based access control (ABAC) — ABAC, sometimes known as policy-based access control, can use a variety of attributes, including user department, time of day, location of access, type of access required, etc. to determine whether a user’s access request should be granted.


role-based access control (RBAC)[1][2] or role-based security[3] is an approach to restricting system access to authorized users. It is an approach to implement mandatory access control (MAC) or discretionary access control (DAC).

Three primary rules are defined for RBAC:

Role assignment: A subject can exercise a permission only if the subject has selected or been assigned a role.
Role authorization: A subject's active role must be authorized for the subject. With rule 1 above, this rule ensures that users can take on only roles for which they are authorized.
Permission authorization: A subject can exercise a permission only if the permission is authorized for the subject's active role. With rules 1 and 2, this rule ensures that users can exercise only permissions for which they are authorized.
