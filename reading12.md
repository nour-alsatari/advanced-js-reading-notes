WebSocket is a computer communications protocol, providing full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection. The WebSocket protocol was standardized by the IETF as RFC 6455 in 2011. The current specification is known as the HTML Living Standard. It is maintained by the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG), a consortium of the major browser vendors (Apple, Google, Mozilla, and Microsoft).

ocket.IO enables real-time bidirectional event-based communication. It works on every platform, browser or device, focusing equally on reliability and speed. Socket.IO is built on top of the WebSockets API (Client side) and Node.js. It is one of the most depended upon library on npm (Node Package Manager).

Real-time Applications
A real-time application (RTA) is an application that functions within a period that the user senses as immediate or current.

Some examples of real-time applications are −

Instant messengers − Chat apps like Whatsapp, Facebook Messenger, etc. You need not refresh your app/website to receive new messages.

Push Notifications − When someone tags you in a picture on Facebook, you receive a notification instantly.

Collaboration Applications − Apps like google docs, which allow multiple people to update same documents simultaneously and apply changes to all people's instances.

Online Gaming − Games like Counter Strike, Call of Duty, etc., are also some examples of real-time applications.

Key features of Socket.IO
It helps in broadcasting to multiple sockets at a time and handles the connection transparently.
It works on all platform, server or device, ensuring equality, reliability, and speed.
It automatically upgrades the requirement to WebSocket if needed.
It is a custom real-time transport protocol implementation on top of other protocols.
It requires both libraries to be used Client side as well as a server-side library.
IO works on work-based events. there are some reserved events that can be accessed using the Socket on the server side like Connect, message, Disconnect, Ping and Reconnect.
There are some Client based reserved events like Connect, connect- error, connect-timeout and Reconnect etc.
